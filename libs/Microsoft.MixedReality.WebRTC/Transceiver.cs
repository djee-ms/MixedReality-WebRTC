    /// A transceiver is a media "pipe" connecting the local and remote peers, and used to transmit media
    /// data (audio or video) between the peers. The transceiver has a media flow direction indicated whether
    /// it is sending and/or receiving any media, or is inactive. When sending some media, the transceiver
    /// local track is used as the source of the media. Conversely, when receiving some media, that media is
    /// delivered to the remote media track of the transceiver. As a convenience, both tracks can be null to
    /// avoid sending or ignore the received media, although this does not influence the media flow direction.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This object corresponds roughly to the same-named notion in the WebRTC standard when using the
    /// Unified Plan SDP semantic.
    /// For Plan B, where RTP transceivers are not available, this wrapper tries to emulate the Unified Plan
    /// transceiver concept, and is therefore providing an abstraction over the WebRTC concept of transceivers.
    /// 
    /// Note that this object is not disposable because the lifetime of the native transceiver is tied to the
    /// lifetime of the peer connection (cannot be removed), and therefore the two collections
    /// <see cref="PeerConnection.AudioTransceivers"/> and <see cref="PeerConnection.VideoTransceivers"/> own
    /// their objects and should continue to contain the list of wrappers for the native transceivers.
